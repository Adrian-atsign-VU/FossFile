Welcome to FossFile Web Tool! This tool is designed for people who want to use profile pictures. 
You can edit the code as long as you give credit.

## How it Works
The main idea behind FossFile is to create random but unique profile pics. 
When you replace your profile picture with one generated by this tool, you'll have a distinctive image that others perceive as random. 
This way, you can protect your privacy by not leaking your actual profile picture or your phone contacts, while still allowing you to identify it.

## Usage
To use FossFile (FOSS/Profile), simply open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Core Version
This is the core version of FossFile (FOSS/Profile). While there are no plans to add more features, the GUI and dimensions could use a little work. Keeping it at 100x100 dimensions is considered the best for now.
